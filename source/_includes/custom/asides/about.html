  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p> I'm Vincent, a recent graduate from <a href="http://www.utsa.edu">UTSA</a>
  and a Software Engineer at
  <a href="http://www.icsolutions.com/">IC Solutions</a></p>
  <p> This blog will be filled with things that I find interesting. At the
    moment, that's primarily functional programming, looking back at the work
    I did during my time as a student, and interesting things that come up at
    work.
