Finally, to paraphrase [Barbosa](https://youtu.be/ceq7Vk-_B-M), **I am job!**

I've already singed the Offer Letter and I'm just waiting for my background
check to clear. After it does, I'll finally be a Software Engineer.

I don't know all the details of the job just yet, but I do know that I'm going
to be primarily--exclusively?--writing in C...which is both scary and exciting.
In school, most of my classes encouraged us to write in C, but all of my big
projects were in Java or Python. I never had the chance to write anything
reasonably complex in C, and now I'll be diving in head first.

Which just might be the best way to go about it.
